                <h4 style="display:inline;">Doing a powerlifting competition is one of the most rewarding things to do in your strength training hobby, </h4><p style="display: inline;">especially if it is your first. The idea of doing a competition to really see where months and months of hard training is without a doubt exciting. Nevertheless, the process of preparing oneself for a competition is more than just deloading towards the big day; there are many things to take into account and prepare for. So here is a brief comprehensive guide for preparing for a competition. It is broken down into 3 main chapters:</p>

                    <li>Competition Day</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Approaching Competition Week</h4>
                <p><b>Know your federation rules</b></p>
                <p>The title says it all, familiarise yourself with the federation rules, understand the technicality of the main lifts. Make sure you know what brands of equipment are approved by your federation and which are not. Each federation has different rules so if you are switching from one federation to another, do not assume that they are the same. Most powerlifting federations will have their rules posted on their websites.</p>
                <p><b>Get your lifts to competition standard</b></p>
                <p>One of the last things you want to is have shoddy rep quality during training. Especially during your final weeks of training, you need to make sure that the quality of your lifts are up to competition standard. It is embarrassing to replicate substandard lifts during the competitions such as not squatting to depth or hitching during a deadlift. For individuals who have poor quality lifts, get your ego out the door, depersonalise yourself and fix it. Do not allow yourself to validate reps that would be red lighted in competition. </p>
                <p><b>Familiarise yourself with the commands</b></p>
                <p>This is more important during your final weeks prior competition. Familiarise yourself with the lift commands, because the last thing you want is to have a red lighted lift from not being familiar with a command. Get a spotter to give you commands during training.</p>
                <p><b>Bodyweight strategy</b></p>
                <p>As a rule of thumb, you really should not be thinking about cutting weight for your first competition. There is an unnecessarily high amount of stress regarding whether you will make weight or not and how you feel perform. 
                Whatever weight category you choose to compete in, make sure you have a strategy ready for making sure that you weigh in correctly during your weigh-in. If you are hovering around 1 to 2kg above competitions weigh category, that is fine and what you should do is do a water cut during the final week prior competition. If you are weighing 2 or more kg above your bodyweight, you may consider doing a slight cut closer to your weight category in the offseason. This applies even more especially if you are not lean ie more than 15% body fat. If you are very lean already ie sub 10% and you are weighing 4 or more kg above your bodyweight, you may consider going up a weight category.
                </p>
                <p><b>Familiarise yourself with competition equipment</b></p>
                <p>Whatever you choose to use on meet day, make sure you are familiar with how to use them. Whether it is a new belt, knee sleeves or even weightlifting shoes, ensure you have used them for at least a few weeks so it does not throw you off during the meet.</p>
<p><b>Peak and Taper well</b></p>
<p>Failure to prepare is preparation to fail. Make sure you have appropriately planned out your peaking and tapering programme for your competition. What you ideally want to do is to gradually peak the intensity of your lifts and gradually taper the total amount of volume. The tapering is to ensure you fully recover from the training stimuli.</p>
<p><b>Ensure lifestyle relaxation</b></p>
<p>It is important that you are physically and psychologically ready for competition. For optimal conditions, you should ensure that you do not have much going on during your final week to minimise stress hormone levels in your body. Being too stressed and not having enough sleep, may cause your body not to recover well and change your appetite too much, which will in turn affect your body weight.</p>
<h4>Prior Competition Day</h4>
<p><b>Go in with a strategy</b></p>
<p>You should go into the competition with a strategy for the attempts. Your openers should be doable even when you are wrecked with bad sleep or what not. Have a rough idea of what you would hit in your 2nd and 3rd attempts if conditions were to be in your way or against. For most powerlifting federations, they give you a short time limit for which you need to pick your next attempt and the last thing you want to do is fluff about trying to figure out your next attempt.</p> 
<p><b>Ensure you sleep well</b></p>
<p>Self explanatory. </p>
<p><b>Ensure your bodyweight</b></p>
<p>This is more of an extension to an earlier point about making bodyweight, on the night before the competition, you should not be more than ~500g heavier that your bodyweight limit. When you sleep, you should wake up slightly lighter as you lose water during your sleep.</p>
<p><b>Ensure you have prepare all your equipment</b></p>
<p>After months of commitment, preparation, and dedicated training the last thing you want is to waste it all by not having for kit ready, to help i've created the big list of competition equipment  to help you get ready!</p>

<h4>Competition Day</h4>
<p><b>Be punctual</p></b>
Self Explanatory, you do not want the stress of being late because of the bloody london underground tube! That stress and rushing will put your game off.</p>
<p><b>Choose appropriate openers - ensure you do not bomb out, it’s shameful!</b></p>
<p>Your openers should be a weight that you can do an easily even with suboptimal conditions. Typically around a 3RM weight or 90% of your 1RM.</p>
<p><b>Warming Up: Earlier is better than later</b></p>
<p>You are better off warming up earlier than later, because you do not want to miss your weight from having a rushed warm up. I have seen this situation happen so frequently that it makes me facepalm. 2 - 5mins rest between each warm up set is a rough idea of the minimum amount of rest you need. </p>
<p>If the venue is in less than optimal conditions ie too cold, I highly recommend that you have a jumper/hoodie and jogging bottoms on to keep your muscles warm. There have been numerous research papers detailing the loss of power output from a dropping muscle temperature.</p> 
<p><b>Prepare to have less than optimal conditions</b></p>
<p>Be mentally ready to have less than optimal lifting conditions e.g. venue being too hot or too cold. Practice stoicism. </p>
<p><b>Get a handler/coach that keeps it objective and get your lifts filmed</b></p>
<p>If you are one of my lifters, do not worry, I will look after you. But it is so useful and stress free to have a handler to ensure you are warming up in time and are ready to lift when you are close to doing an attempt. It is also useful to have a coach/handler or friend to record the lifts to give feedback. It is important that your handler/coach can keep things objective, sometimes our egos get the best of us and we do not make objective and/or logical decisions such as weight attempts. Your coach/handler must be able to tell you how it is and not what you want to hear.</p>
<p><b>Manage your caffeine and energy wisely</b></p>
<p>You have a whole day of lifting. I have seen a few amateurs who have completely wasted their caffeine for a big squat and they are wrecked for deadlift. Time your caffeine intake right.</p>
<p>I personally recommend casually sipping caffeine from your first attempt of squat, and a huge amount (preferably in pill form), when you are about to do your last bench attempt so you are amped up to smash the deadlifts. For those of you who get very jittery or anxious from caffeine, I insist on the use of L-Theanine. L-Theanine is a naturally occuring amino acid that occurs in green tea and plenty of research show its relaxation and stress reducing effects without sedation. Other benefits that the L-theanine and Caffeine combination provide are improving alertness and sustaining improved attention.</p>
<p><b>Good sportsmanship pays off</b></p>
<p>Mark 12:31 “Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.”</p>
<p>Seriously, good sportsmanship will always pay off. Do not be an arrogant guy who only gives a shit about what is going on with his or her lifting. If you support others whether it is loading plates or cheering, you will find that others will do the same back. Be friendly to other people.</p>
